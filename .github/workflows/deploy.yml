# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Deploy

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # todo remove this after testing
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# TODO
# either move back to private repo and setup vault management (no worry aobut public, ask connor his thoughts)
  # free has more control over brnach which will make deployments better
# keep open and free and use ssh key with better protections, likely

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
